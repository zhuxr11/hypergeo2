## Resubmission of hypergeo2 0.1.0

* Refined the Description field of redundant "This package".

* Single-quoted all software names ('gmp' and 'mpfr') across all documents.

* This method is a simple implementation of 'gmp' and 'mpfr' floating-point datatypes on `boost::math::hypergeometric_pFq()` from `BH` package, so that the function can derive precise results. Unfortunately, there are currently no related references or publications. They will be added as soon as published in the future.
